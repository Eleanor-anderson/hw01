##This is my brief Biography!

My name is Eleanor Anderson. I am a current fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Psychology. I am planning on graduating this quarter and am applying to graduate schools. I wanted to take this class becuase I have had a handful of classes that use R but I never truly learned how R works, I mostly learned how to plug and chug. I am **very** *excited* to learn how to actually use R!
