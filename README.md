## This is my brief Biography!

My name is Eleanor Anderson. I am a current fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Psychology. I am planning on graduating this quarter and am applying to graduate schools. I wanted to take this class becuase I have had a handful of classes that use R but I never truly learned how R works, I mostly learned how to plug and chug. I am **very** *excited* to learn how to actually use R!

My main hobbies and interests are as follows:

* Dance
* Music (both playing and listening)
* Cooking and Baking
* Knitting 

### Dance

Dance is probably what I spend the majority of my time doing! It is so freeing and I get to spend time with some of the greatest people I know! I have attached a picture of my dance group below:
